* Introduction
** Problem Description

*** Left
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.5
:END:
- total of $n_A$ buses in the fleet
- $n_V$ visits[fn:1] to the station divided between the $n_A$ buses
- Each bus in initialized with a charge of $\alpha_b \kappa_i$

*** Right
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.5
:END:
- After each visit the bus goes on its route and discharges by $\Delta_i$
- The charge is not allowed to go below $\nu_b \kappa_i$ during operational hours
- Each bus is required to finish the day with a minimum charge of $\beta_b \kappa_i$[fn:2]

** Mixed Integer Linear Programming

\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:milp-structure}
\begin{align}
&\text{max}        &J = \sum_j c_j x_j + \sum_k d_k y_k&         &               &\label{eq:fuzzy-milp-objective}\\
&\text{subject to} &\sum_j a_{ij} x_j + \sum_k g_{ik} y_k \le b_i&  &(i = 1,2,...,m)& \label{eq:fuzzy-milp-constraint}\\
&                  &x_j \ge 0&                              &(j = 1,2,...,n)& \label{eq:fuzzy-milp-continuous}\\
&                  &y_k \in \mathbb{Z^+}&                   &(k = 1,2,...,n)& \label{eq:fuzzy-milp-integer}\\
&\end{align}
\end{subequations}

- $J$: Objective function
- $x_j \in \mathbb{R}$ and $y_k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$: Decision Variables
- $c_j, d_k, a_{ij}, g_{ik}, b_i \in \mathbb{R}$: Parameters

** The Berth Allocation Problem[fn:3]
The BAP solves the problem of optimally assigning incoming vessels to berth positions to be serviced

** The Berth Allocation Problem
The BAP is a variant of the rectangle packing problem

[fn:2] PAP application only

[fn:1]  A visit is when a bus arrives, receives a charge, and then departs
